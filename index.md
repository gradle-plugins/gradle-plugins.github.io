# Gradle plugin analysis service

Hi there!
Glad you could join us.
As any community grow, users want to provide the fantastic success they got by sharing the code that brought them so much success.
As everyone in the community appreciates this, the codebase, best practice, and guideline keep evolving.
We understand it's hard and unfair to ask contributors to keep up-to-date with everything that happens.
This service aims to be an analysis tool for plugins hosted on the [plugin portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/) to inform the authors and users.
The information provides will eventually range from bad practice, preferred guidelines, security issues, and sneaky behaviors (potentially malicious).
The goal is to ensure the highest code quality for our community plugins.
Don't be discouraged, keep contributing to the community while keeping an eye on this analysis service to see how to improve your plugin code.

## How does it work?
The service scraps the plugin portal and performs analysis on the plugin.
At the moment, only static analysis is performed.
Later, we will perform a dynamic analysis to ensure the plugin is well behaved.
After the analysis, the plugin is attributed a DAN unit amount.
The higher the number the more in trouble you would be if Daniel was standing behind you while you code :-)

## Can I proactively analyze my plugin before publishing it to the plugin portal?
It will be possible to do it in the future.
Now, we are concentrating around the fundamental analysis of all the plugins.

## How can I contribute?
This is a pet-project so my time is quite limited.
However, being a native developer at my core, I would greatly appreciate any help around the Web design... if you haven't figured that out yet.

# Stay tuned!
